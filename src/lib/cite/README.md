cite
====

This is a Python library, but all the heavy lifting is done by the `cite` Ruby program because `citeproc-py` sucks.

The required gems are not included in the repo. There is a Gemfile, but it won't work, as `csl` requires a different version of `namae`.

If you manhandle the gems into place, the code does, however, run.

Check the `cite` program to see where the gems need to be placed.
